About Class Groups
==================

1.  There are two types of Class Groups in SLS:
    
    *   Class Groups (Class) are created using subject class and teaching group information imported from School Cockpit. Class Groups are assigned a specific colour based on the subject type e.g. green for Sciences, orange for Mathematics.
        
        Note: If you are unable to see the Class Groups, please check with your School Cockpit administrator if you have been assigned classes/teaching groups in School Cockpit. You may also contact SLS Helpdesk.
        
    *   Class Groups (Groups) are created by Teachers in SLS. Students and Teachers can be added to the Group.
