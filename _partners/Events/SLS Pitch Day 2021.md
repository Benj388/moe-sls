 The inaugural SLS Pitch Day was held on 15 September 2021 to provide a platform for participants to propose products and services that would be useful for teaching and learning and have potential for integration with SLS. Participants came up with pitches in response to a Task Statement and shortlisted pitches were presented live over videoconferencing to an evaluation panel comprised of senior management from MOE.
