Overview of SLS System
----------------------
---

1. **What is SLS?** 
<br>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) is one of MOE’s key initiatives to transform the learning experiences of Singaporean students through the purposeful use of technology to enable students to engage in different learning modes, including self-directed and collaborative learning. All school leaders, teachers and students in the national school system have access to the SLS.
    
    The SLS is an online learning portal providing equal access to quality curriculum-aligned resources in major subjects from primary to pre-university level, in line with the development of [21st Century Competencies](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/21st-century-competencies) (21CC).
    
    The SLS also provides teachers with a range of tools to customise and create meaningful learning experiences that cater to diverse learning needs. For example, teachers have access to tools that help to make students’ thinking processes visible. This enables teachers to make informed decisions and provide targeted intervention to address any gaps in understanding.
    
    The SLS also serves as a common online platform for teachers to apply, adapt and share new pedagogies by facilitating collaborations across classrooms and schools.
    
    The SLS is continually being developed in response to needs of students and teachers. Curriculum-aligned resources and system tools are continually being improved and developed in line with suggestions and feedback from teachers and students to cater to students’ diverse and evolving learning needs.

  
Access to SLS

1. **Who has access to SLS?**
    
     MOE has rolled out SLS to all national schools from primary, secondary to junior colleges since 25 May 2018. SLS is also available to schools outside of the national school system, including NIE users, seconded EOs and Young Overseas Singaporeans (aged 7 to 16).
2. **How can Young Overseas Singaporeans request for SLS accounts?**
    
    Young Overseas Singaporeans can obtain access as follows:
    
    
    - Students on [Leave of Absence (LOA)](https://go.gov.sg/loa) from a Singapore school should request for continued access to the SLS through the school.
    Students that are granted LOA will remain as a registered student of their current school so that they can be re-admitted to their current school directly after returning to Singapore. The school will provide these students with support in administrative and academic areas, including access to SLS. [More information on the LOA scheme can be found here.](https://go.gov.sg/loa)
    
    - Young Overseas Singaporeans who are not on LOA from a Singapore school but intend to return to Singapore’s education system [can apply for access to the SLS through this application form.](https://go.gov.sg/applyforsls)
